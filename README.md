## Overview

goboxd is an HTTP service written in Go that compiles and runs untrusted code inside isolated sandboxes and returns the result. Optional test cases can be supplied to assert behaviour against expected output. It is built for safe execution of code across many languages, with strict isolation, bounded concurrency, and a plug and play language registry.

## Features

- Plug and play language registry driven by YAML
- Process isolation using Linux namespaces and cgroups
- Bounded concurrency with request queuing
- Fully containerised for local development and deployment
- Per request resource limits for time, memory, and processes
- Liveness and readiness probes for orchestration

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose v2

No Go toolchain or system dependencies are required on the host. Everything runs in containers.

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thesouldev/goboxd.git
cd goboxd
make build
```

### Usage

```sh
make run          # start the service on :8080
make test         # run unit tests
make integration  # run end to end tests
make lint         # run static analysis
```
